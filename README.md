# javac-src
A simple script for compiling and executing java source files within packages without having to type the -cp and -d paths during compilation. I created this mainly to make it easier to quick java applications with sublime text.

## Possible Uses
* Sublime Text: copy the `Java.sublime-build file` to your sublime text user packages folder and make a new directory called `JavaCompiler`. Then move `Compile.java` into that folder and compile it in the same directory (creating `Compile.class` and `PrintThread.class`) Now you can run java code with packages through sublime text.
